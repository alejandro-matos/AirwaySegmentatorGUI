#nnUNet GUI: A User-Friendly Tool for Airway Segmentation
 
 This Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a streamlined workflow for converting medical imaging data and generating 3D models of the upper airway. With just a few clicks, you can: 
 1. **Convert DICOM to NIfTI**: Easily transform your DICOM images into the NIfTI file format, a common standard for medical image analysis.
 2. **Automatic Airway Segmentation**: Leverage the power of the "AirwaySegmentor" neural network model, trained using the nnUNet framework, to automatically segment the upper airway from your CBCT scans.
 3. **Generate STL Models**: Convert the resulting segmentations into STL files, a widely-used format for 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) applications. With its intuitive interface and automated processes, the nnUNet GUI simplifies the complex task of airway segmentation, enabling researchers, clinicians, and engineers to easily extract and visualize 3D models of the upper airway from medical imaging data.
